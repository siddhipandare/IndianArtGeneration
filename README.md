# Indian Art Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks

The dataset consists of 4771 images spanning 8 classes. The images are 64 * 64. Data augmentation techniques such as horizontal flips, blurring and variations in hue and saturation were applied. The images were scraped from different search engines like Bing, DuckGO and Flickr. (No copyright was intended).
